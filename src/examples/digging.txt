        Note : for some reason the declarer hand is set up as the public hand for the dummy.
        self.x_play contains the cards played as 13 list of binaries repr, one for each card played
        self.hand52 contains the hand of the player as a list of binaries (except for dummy)
        self.public52 contains the dummy hand as a list of binaries (except for dummy)
    each card played :
        card_player[player_i].set_own_card_played52(card52)
        if player_i==1 : (dummy)
            card_player.set_public_card_played52(card52) for all cards players except dummy
        if player_i==3 : (declarer)
            dummy.set_public_card_played52(card52) # Why this ? Because of the curious point mentionned before
shown_out_suit :
    A list of set, each set containing the shown_out suit as a number(spades=0,clubs=3)
    Updated for each card play     
players_cards played:
	a list of 4 list(left,dummy,right,declarer). 32 repr
	Updated only when the trick is finished
current_trick : 
	the current trick, is the order the card have been played. 32 repr
self.padded_auction : 
	The auction, with the pad at the begining
card_players[player_i].hand.reshape((-1, 32)) :
	The 13 cards of a player, reshaped into a list. Not updated trough tricks. 32 repr 
self.vuln :
	The vuls, as a list of two bools

After each trick is done :
    for each card played, init the x_play slice of the next trick. Pain in the ass
